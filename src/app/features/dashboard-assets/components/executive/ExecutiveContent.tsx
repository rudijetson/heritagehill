        <p>
          Heritage Hill was founded on a powerful belief: the greatest economic opportunities 
          emerge from creating cooperative, community-centered supply chain ecosystems. 
          Recognizing the immense untapped potential within the HBCU ecosystem, Divine Nine 
          fraternities and sororities, and the broader Black community, we saw a path to foster 
          genuine economic sovereignty and sustainable commercial success.

        <p>
          From this journey, we have created a replicable framework for designing equitable, 
          cooperative supply chains that meet the unique needs of historically underserved 
          communities. By combining our insights, challenges, and achievements, this presentation 
          serves as a roadmap for future innovations aimed at transforming the economic landscape 
          of the Black Diaspora and beyond.
