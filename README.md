# Heritage Hill: A Case Study in Cooperative Economics

## About This Project
This dashboard presents the journey of Heritage Hill LLC (2019-2023), a proof-of-concept venture that explored building economic infrastructure within the Black diaspora. As the founder, I ([Brandon Z. Hoff](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hoffbrandon/)) wanted to create a comprehensive visualization of our learnings and data.

## Data & Development Process
- **Data Source**: All financial and operational data extracted from Heritage Hill's QuickBooks (2019-2023)
- **Development Time**: Approximately 10 hours total
- **AI-Assisted Development**: 
  - Used Anthropic's Claude for initial architecture planning and code structuring
  - Leveraged Vercel v0 for component prototyping
  - Utilized Cursor IDE for AI-assisted development

### Development Workflow
1. **Data Organization**:
   - Extracted and structured QuickBooks data
   - Used generative AI to help organize and analyze patterns
   - Created data visualization strategies

2. **Architecture Planning**:
   - Used Claude to plan component structure
   - Implemented v0-generated folder architecture
   - Organized code around data structure

3. **Implementation**:
   - Built with Next.js 13+ and TypeScript
   - Utilized Framer Motion for animations
   - Implemented Recharts for data visualization
   - Styled with Tailwind CSS

## Key Learnings
- Importance of proper data organization before development
- Value of AI tools in structuring complex applications
- Benefits of component-first architecture
- Power of visualization in telling business stories
